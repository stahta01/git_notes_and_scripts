Problem "git gc" locks up

Does any of these complete?

# Test steps
# A
git gc --keep-largest-pack --no-prune   
# B
git gc --keep-largest-pack              
# C
git gc --no-prune                       

# Fix steps
If A Fails no reason to do B and C just consider them to have failed
If any of them fail then run "git fsck" followed by "git prune"

If A or C fails run "git repack -d" after doing fsck and prune

Repeat the A,B,C test steps after running fix steps.

If they fail a second time though, with no changes in results, 
  run "git repack" with options "-d", "-a", or "-ad"
I am not sure which option fixes the issue; so, try them all in order or just do "-ad".

If they fail a third time though run the steps in safe mode

msconfig can be used to set reboot to safe mode
